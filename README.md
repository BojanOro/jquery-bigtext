jquery-bigtext
==============
jQuery plugin that makes text inside as big as possible while still fitting on the parent.

Requirements
==============
jQuery 1.3.1 or higher

Browser Compatibility
==============
Internet Explorer 9 or higher

Opera

Firefox

Google Chrome

Safari


Usage
==============
```javascript
$("#div").bigText({
  padding: {Number},
  rotateText: {Number},
  fontSizeFactor: {Number}
});
```

Options
==============
padding: Add X pixels of padding to the parent element. You can also set this directly on the CSS of the parent element.

fontSizeFactor: default is 0.8, it's used to give some vertical spacing for letters that overflow the line-height (like 'g', '√Å' and most other accentuated uppercase letters). This does not affect the font-size if the limiting factor is the width of the parent div.

rotateText: Rotates the text inside the element by X degrees.

Note: BigText, unlike padding, does not support setting the rotation of the text element on CSS. You must set through the $.bigText() options.
